# Stroke Rate Trainer for iOS
This is a simple metronome app that plays a beep at the selected rate in seconds per cycle. 
This can be used to train cycle rates in swimming or other sports. 
Example usage would be playing the rate to an athlete or group of athletes through the phone speaker, bluetooth speaker or headsets before or during a practice repeat so they learn the target tempo they are trying to achieve.

## Features
- Select target tempo by using the slider and fine tune using the plus/minus buttons.
- Tempo can also be selected from the picker wheel, which shows the average of the top 3 finishers' stroke rates taken at 2016 US Olympic Swimming Trials for each event (data courtesy of Russell Mark from USA Swimming).
- Tempo can also be set by taking the stroke rate of an athlete using the Take Rate button
- Tempo can be multiplied by 2 or divided by 2 using the yellow x2/%2 buttons to quickly change between 1 beep per cycle and 1 beep per arm.
- A separate Target Tempos screen can be viewed, which shows the range between the fastest and slowest stroke rates taken for the top 8 athletes in each event at 2016 US Olympic Swimming Trials (data courtesy of Russell Mark from USA Swimming).
